/*
 * This function expects a work factor between 4 and 31 and a char array to
 * store the resulting generated salt. The char array should typically have
 * BCRYPT_HASHSIZE bytes at least. If the provided work factor is not in the
 * previous range, it will default to 12.
 *
 * The return value is zero if the salt could be correctly generated and
 * nonzero otherwise. Given that, internally, the code uses /dev/urandom to
 * read a few random bytes needed for the salt, the different return values are
 * as follow:
 *
 *	1:	Unable to open /dev/urandom
 *	2:	Unable to read needed data.
 *	3:	Unable to close file descriptor.
 *	4:	Unable to read needed data and unable to close file descriptor.
 *	5:	Error generating salt.

 * This function expects a password to be hashed, a salt to hash the password

 * hashed password. In that case, provide the expected hash in the salt
 * parameter and verify the output hash is the same as the input hash. Both the
 * salt and the hash parameters should have room for BCRYPT_HASHSIZE characters
 * at least.
 *
 * The return value is zero if the password could be hashed and nonzero
 * otherwise.

 * Brief Example
 * -------------
 *
 * Hashing a password:

 *	char salt[BCRYPT_HASHSIZE];
 *	char hash[BCRYPT_HASHSIZE];
 *
 *	assert(bcrypt_gensalt(12, salt) == 0);
 *	assert(bcrypt_hashpw("thepassword", salt, hash) == 0);
 *
 *
 * Verifying a password:
 *
 *	char outhash[BCRYPT_HASHSIZE];
 *
 *	assert(bcrypt_hashpw("thepassword", "expectedhash", outhash) == 0);
 *
 *	if (strcmp("expectedhash", outhash) == 0) {
 *		printf("The password matches\n");
 *	} else {
