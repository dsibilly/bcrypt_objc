This library is a simple wrapper providing a convenient reentrant interface for
the bcrypt password hashing algorithm implementation as provided by Solar
Designer at http://www.openwall.com/crypt/. An exact copy of that source code
is included with minor Makefile modifications in the crypt_blowfish
subdirectory.

The provided C interface is inspired in the bcrypt Python module that can be
found at http://code.google.com/p/py-bcrypt/, and consists of a function to
generate salts with the characteristic work factor parameter, and one to
generate password hashes, which in turn is also used to verify passwords.

All this code is released to the public domain.
